# Oblig 1 - Option B - Resturant Page
For this task we wanted to create a very simple page of high quality without much HTML and CSS experience. We wanted it to be modern, universal and contain a nice colour-scheme. The page needed to contain enough space between images and text boxes.

Therefore, we chose to go for the font “Popins” and a darker red as the main color. The font is very modern and it follows multiple font-weights with the kit, which make the page look more appealing.
 
Instead of finding a logo online, we choose to design a very simple and recognizable logo in Adobe Illustrator. We gave the logo the color we wanted to use further in this project.

The idea for the menu/concept/website was that we wanted it to fit all kinds of people, lifestyles and allergies. Which means, if you are vegetarian or vegan, lactose intolerant etc., you will be able to find dishes in our menu that will fit your requirements. We wanted it to be marked very clearly in our menu. The customer will be able to choose between different proteins, types of bread and exceptions. If not, the restaurant (and website) would not be universal, which is very important these days. 

After uploading the first version to a web accessibility checker 
(https://achecker.achecks.ca/checker/index.php), a lot of potential problems came up (45 problems) and none known or likely problems. Some of the potential problems pointed out the link text (<a href="#">MENU</a>), which makes sense, since we haven’t made the other pages yet. We changed the link text and connected it to the different pages, even though they're empty. 

The web checker also pointed out the alt-text to our images, saying the image may contain text that is not in alt-text. I find that strange, because I could not figure out what else I could’ve written as my alt-text to solve the problem. I’ve worked with SEO before and the alt-text can basically be whatever you want it to be, as long as it has a context with the image and you make sure it can optimize the SEO, which is more a test-and-fail method.  

Therefore, we chose not to do a second version because we didn’t find the potential problems necessary to do a second version.
